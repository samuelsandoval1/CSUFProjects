### Explanation
<b> To setup the program, either replace the text in input_sourcecode.txt with your tester file, or replace it with another file and rename that one to "input_sourcecode.txt".
Then, all you need to do is run the implementation file "lexer.py" by entering the following into the terminal:
    --> cd Implementation
    --> python3 lexer.py
This will populate the output.txt file with each of the tokens and their corresponding lexemes in the order in which they appear in the file.
